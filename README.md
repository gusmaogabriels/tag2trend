* ODBC connection between PC-AspenTech InfoPlus.21 (IP21): `pyodbc`
* Data, time, timezone: `datetime`
* Ubiquity among objects: `ctypes`
* Regular expressions: `re`
* Scientific units: `pint`
* Object untanglement: `copy`
* Interpolation, derivation, integration: `scipy`
* General data handling: `numpy`
* Data visualization: `maplotlib`
